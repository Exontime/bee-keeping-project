# 3 counties Bee keepers club page- ongoing work project. 
This branch is the ongoing work with this project for reconsideration.  

My goal for this project is to get the page up and running. 
Once I have the basics done, I plan on regular updates and add to it as I learn more.
It will be in everyday use and the committee are anxious I get this up.
They view it as mostly a noticeboard and thing "that is needed because everyone has a webpage"
Unfortunately after brainstorming with the crew (average age 68),
I have been informed that simply having a page is all they want. 
So this is all on me. 
No preference for styles/design/colors. 
2 requirements. 1 use the club logo. 
                2 Everything BIG because the users are old and needs glasses
                (unofficial request, check photos for anything unflattering)

So this page is going to start life as a little noticeboard page. 
Hopefully we can combine information and expand the education section. 

Honestly. I have been dying with the cold. I was told if I submit anything at all, by the 20th of Jan. I can update it and change my grade. 
Also I am finding that the /* adfads */ note feature in github not working. When I use it, the writing appears as text. 

## code from previous projects. 
I have used code from previous projects in the style.css.
it is the modifications to the nav. colors and orientation has been changed to show I understand how the code works.

### Bootstrap help. 
Nav bar brand. Used to get the logo on the top of the page. I pulled the image from Facebook to show I could link to an outside source. 
This needs to be fixed when I get the proper image. 



### code I did myself.
